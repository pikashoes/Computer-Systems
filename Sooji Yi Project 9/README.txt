Instructions for Playing the MazeGame
--------------------------------------
* This game is a maze that is designed to test your accuracy and nimbleness with the keyboard! While it might be simple to figure out the route, getting to the end is not easy with the small spaces the person must go through.
* Use the UP, RIGHT, LEFT, and DOWN arrow keys to move around. You may hit the edge of the screen with no consequences, but hitting the lines will cause the game to be over.
* You must reach the end at the bottom right, at a small point labeled "END" for you to win.

How to Open the Game
--------------------
* Compile the .jack files using the JackCompiler.sh.
* Run the directory containing the resulting files with the VMEmulator.

NOTE
----_
* This game does not end when the left/right edges of the square touch the line. It is only when corners touch the line, acting as the top and bottom edges of the square. However, moving out of the line after going through it from the left or right will end the game, so it is effectively still signaling game over.
