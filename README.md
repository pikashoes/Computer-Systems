MPCS: Introduction to Computer Systems (52011)

This course follows Nand2Tetris guidelines, with weekly assignments that ultimately results in a basic computer. In this respository, you will find code I have written using Assembly language, Jack language, and Python. I create things like the compiler and the assembler.

The full course details are available here: http://www.nand2tetris.org/
