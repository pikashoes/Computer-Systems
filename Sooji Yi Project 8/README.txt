Files
-----
* VMTranslator.py
* codewriter.py
* parser.py

How to compile/run the program
------------------------------
* The correct syntax is:
	python VMTranslator.py <filename or directory>
* The filename should end in .vm if it is the filename alone.
* If it is a directory, the name of the folder also works if it is in the same directory as the python files.
* You must change directories (cd) into the same directory where VMTranslator.py is located.
* If your file is located in a different directory, please put the directory even if it is for one file and not for a folder.

Important Notes BEFORE running program
--------------------------------------
* One thing to note is that when a .vm file is put through the VMTranslator using the syntax above in "How to compile/run the program", all white spaces AND comments will be stripped except for spaces and new lines (unless the line is empty).
* If you would like to keep your original, commented .vm file, PLEASE MAKE A COPY.
